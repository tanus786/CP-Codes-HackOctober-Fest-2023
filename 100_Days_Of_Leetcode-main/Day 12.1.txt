202. Happy Number

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1



class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        int d,k=0;
        while(n>6)
        {
            k=0;
            while(n!=0)
            {
                d=n%10;
                k=k+(int)Math.pow(d,2);
                n/=10;
            }
            n=k;
        }
        if(n==1)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
}
