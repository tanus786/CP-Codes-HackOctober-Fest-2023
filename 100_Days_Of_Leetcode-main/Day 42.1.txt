926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing

A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's (possibly none), followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string s. You can flip s[i] changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of flips to make s monotone increasing.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
Example 2:

Input: s = "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
Example 3:

Input: s = "00011000"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
