392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?





class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if(s.length()==0&&t.length()>=0)
            return true;
        for(int i=0,j=0;i<s.length()&&j<t.length();j++)
        {
            if(s.charAt(i)==t.charAt(j))
            {
                System.out.println(i+" "+j+" "+s.charAt(i)+" "+t.charAt(j));
                i++;
            }
            if(i==s.length())
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
