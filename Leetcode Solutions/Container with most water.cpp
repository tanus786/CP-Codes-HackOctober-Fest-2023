You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int maxi = 0;
        while(left < right){
            int w = right - left;
            int h = min(height[left], height[right]);
            int area = h * w;
            maxi = max(maxi, area);
            if(height[left] < height[right]) left++;
            else if(height[left] > height[right]) right--;
            else {
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
